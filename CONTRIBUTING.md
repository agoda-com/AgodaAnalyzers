Please ensure that:

- Your analyzer uses a DiagnosticID (eg. AG0XXX) that is not already assigned. If in doubt, see existing issues (open and closed) to determine the next free ID.
- If you wish to propose a new analyzer then create one with the title in the format "AG0XXX: My analyzer title" and label it "New rule".
- Assign yourself to your issue and move it to the "In Progress" column on our [project board](https://github.com/agoda-com/AgodaAnalyzers/projects/1)
- You tag your pull request as a fix for the issue (put something like "Fixes "#31" in the description). 
- Your PR should includes changes only for a single issue.
