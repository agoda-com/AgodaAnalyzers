## Contributing

- If you wish to propose a new analyzer then create one with the title in the format "AG0XXX: My analyzer title" and label it "New rule". Make sure your analyzer uses a DiagnosticID (eg. AG0XXX) that is not already assigned. If in doubt, see existing issues (open and closed) to determine the next free ID.
- To work on an existing issue, assign yourself and move it to "In Progress" on our [project board](https://github.com/agoda-com/AgodaAnalyzers/projects/1)
- When you're done, create a PR (with unit tests!) and link it to the original issue. You can do this by putting something like "Closes #31" in the description. When your PR is approved, the issue will automatically be closed.
- Please make sure your PR includes changes only for a single issue. Open a new PR to work on a different analyzer.
