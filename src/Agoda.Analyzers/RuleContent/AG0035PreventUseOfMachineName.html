<p>
    Do not use <code>Environment.MachineName</code>.

<ul>
    <li>Use of machine name tightly couples your code to the our infrastructure and naming scheme, which can and will change over time.</li>
    <li>Your code should be agnostic of Environment, Data Center, Cluster and Server. Having different code paths for different environments can lead to bugs can only be caught in production.</li>
    <li>Such environmental concerns are usually only relevant when connecting to external services, as you want to hit the service running in your local data center. For this, use a Services configuration in Consul, which can automatically inject you the correct server address based on your environment.</li>
</ul>
