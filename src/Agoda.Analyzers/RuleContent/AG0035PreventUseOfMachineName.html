    Do not use <code>Environment.MachineName</code>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use of machine name tightly couples your code to the our infrastructure and its naming scheme, which can and will change over time.</li>
    <li>Your code should be agnostic of environment, data center, cluster and server. Having different code paths for different environments can lead to bugs that can only be caught in production.</li>
    <li>Such environmental variations are usually only required when calling external services, as you will want to call the service running in your local data center. For this, use Consul's service discovery. It automatically supplies the correct configuration based on your environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    One exception is logging, where it can be useful to see the exact DC / cluster / server that made the request. Here, it makes sense to log the machine name.
