        <li>We are all familiar with CSS selectors, but many of us are not comfortable with XPath.</li>

<h2>Don't</h2>
<pre>
    // What do all those characters even mean? I don't even want to have to know.
    Driver.FindElements(By.XPath(".//*[@data-selenium='hotel-item']")) 
</pre>

<h2>Do</h2>
<pre>
    Driver.FindElements(By.CssSelector("[data-selenium=hotel-item]"))
</pre>
