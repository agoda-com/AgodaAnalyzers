    Do not use dynamics in C#
</p>

<p>
    Dynamics were invented to allow the CLR to interoperate more easily with dynamically typed languages. We do not do
    this in Agoda - we move between Scala, C# and Typescript, all of which are statically typed. Therefore,
    we have no use case for dynamics.
