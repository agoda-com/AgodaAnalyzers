# Avoid hard-coded type strings

Hard-coded strings to identify namespaces and types make refactoring risky and move type resolution errors from compile-time to runtime. Always use the `typeof` operator to reference types, which provides compile-time safety.

#### Don't

```csharp
// Both fail at runtime after namespace changes
var instance = Activator.CreateInstance("Agoda", "Agoda.MyType");
var type = Type.GetType("Agoda.MyType");
```

#### Do

```csharp
// Caught at compile time after namespace changes
var instance = Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(Agoda.MyType));
var type = typeof(Agoda.MyType);
```

Using string literals for type identification creates several problems:

- Refactoring operations like namespace moves or type renames won't update the strings
- Type resolution failures only surface at runtime instead of compile time
- No IntelliSense or IDE support for type names
- More difficult to maintain as type references aren't tracked by development tools
- Can lead to runtime exceptions in production that could have been caught during development

Always use language features like `typeof()` that provide compile-time type safety and refactoring support.
