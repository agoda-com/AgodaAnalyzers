# Don't Use MachineName

ID: AG0035

Type: Code Smell / Architecture

## Summary

Avoid using `MachineName` in your code logic. Using machine names creates tight coupling to infrastructure and can lead to environment-specific bugs.

## Explanation

Using `MachineName`:

- Couples code to infrastructure naming conventions
- Creates different code paths per environment
- Makes testing difficult
- Can mask issues until production
- Breaks cloud-native principles
- Makes deployment and scaling harder
- Reduces portability

Exception: Logging is allowed to use `MachineName` for traceability.

### Don't ❌

```csharp
// Environment-specific logic
if (Environment.MachineName.StartsWith("PROD"))
{
    url = "https://prod.api.example.com";
}
else if (Environment.MachineName.StartsWith("STG"))
{
    url = "https://staging.api.example.com";
}

// Hard-coded machine dependencies
public class Service
{
    private readonly string _configPath = 
        Environment.MachineName == "SERVER1" 
            ? @"\\server1\config" 
            : @"\\server2\config";
}

// Direct infrastructure coupling
if (Environment.MachineName.Contains("DC1"))
{
    useDataCenter1();
}
```

## Why Avoid MachineName?

- Makes code environment-dependent
- Complicates deployment and scaling
- Creates hidden production-only bugs
- Breaks containerization
- Harder to test and maintain
- Not cloud-native friendly
- Makes configuration more complex

Instead:

- Use service discovery (e.g., Consul)
- Use configuration management
- Use environment variables
- Implement proper dependency injection
- Use cloud-native patterns

Remember: Service discovery and proper configuration management should handle environment-specific needs, not machine names.
