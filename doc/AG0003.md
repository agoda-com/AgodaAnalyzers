# Avoid passing HttpContext as a parameter

Passing `System.Web.HttpContext` as a parameter creates tight coupling to the web infrastructure and makes unit testing significantly more difficult. Instead, pass only the specific HttpContext properties that your code actually needs.

#### Don't

```csharp
using System.Web;

interface ISomething 
{
    void SomeMethod(HttpContext c, string sampleString); // Noncompliant
}
            
class TestClass: ISomething 
{
    public void SomeMethod(HttpContext context, string sampleString) 
    {
        // Hard to test due to HttpContext dependency
    }

    public TestClass(System.Web.HttpContext context) 
    {
        // Constructor with HttpContext dependency
    }
}
```

#### Do

```csharp
using System.Web;

interface ISomething 
{
    void SomeMethod(string userAgent, string sampleString);
}
            
class TestClass: ISomething 
{
    public void SomeMethod(string userAgent, string sampleString) 
    {
        // Only depends on what it needs
    }

    public TestClass(string userAgent) 
    {
        // Clean constructor with specific dependencies
    }
}
```

Passing HttpContext creates several problems:

- Makes unit testing difficult since HttpContext is complex to mock
- Violates Single Responsibility Principle by potentially accessing many different context properties
- Creates tight coupling to ASP.NET infrastructure
- Obscures the actual dependencies of your code
- Makes it harder to port code to other platforms or frameworks

Instead, identify and pass only the specific HttpContext properties your code needs (like UserAgent, Request.Path, etc). This improves testability and makes dependencies explicit.
