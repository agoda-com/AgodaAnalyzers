# Components should have a single public constructor

ID: AG0006

Type: Code Smell

Each component registered with the dependency injection container should have exactly one public constructor. Having multiple public constructors leads to ambiguity in dependency resolution and makes the codebase harder to maintain.

Reasons to avoid multiple public constructors:

- Creates ambiguity for the DI container when resolving dependencies
- Makes it harder to track and manage dependencies
- Increases complexity of dependency resolution
- Makes code harder to test and maintain
- Can lead to runtime errors if wrong constructor is chosen
- Violates the Single Responsibility Principle

If a dependency is truly optional, use the null object pattern instead of multiple constructors:

```csharp
// Don't do this
public class Service
{
    public Service() { }  // Noncompliant - multiple constructors
    
    public Service(ILogger logger) { }
}

// Do this instead
public class Service
{
    public Service(ILogger logger = null)  // Single constructor with optional dependency
    {
        _logger = logger ?? NullLogger.Instance;
    }
}
```

Always prefer explicit dependency declaration through a single constructor for clearer and more maintainable code.
