# AG0043: BuildServiceProvider should not be used in production code

## Problem Description
Using `BuildServiceProvider()` in production code can lead to memory leaks and other issues because it creates a new container. This is especially problematic when called repeatedly, such as in request processing scenarios.

## Rule Details
This rule raises an issue when `BuildServiceProvider()` is called on `IServiceCollection` instances.

### Noncompliant Code Examples

#### Traditional ASP.NET Core
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
    var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider(); // Noncompliant
    var myService = serviceProvider.GetService<IMyService>();
}
```

#### Minimal API
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => 
{
    var serviceProvider = app.Services.BuildServiceProvider(); // Noncompliant
    var myService = serviceProvider.GetService<IMyService>();
    return myService.GetMessage();
});

app.Run();
```

### Compliant Solutions

#### Traditional ASP.NET Core
```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
        // Let ASP.NET Core build the service provider
    }
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IMyService myService)
    {
        // Services are injected by the framework
    }
}
```

#### Minimal API
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", (IMyService myService) => myService.GetMessage());

app.Run();

// Service interfaces and implementations
public interface IMyService
{
    string GetMessage();
}

public class MyService : IMyService
{
    public string GetMessage() => "Hello from MyService!";
}
```

## Why is this an Issue?
1. **Memory Leaks**: Each call to `BuildServiceProvider()` creates a new dependency injection container, which holds references to all registered services. If called repeatedly (e.g., during request processing), this leads to memory leaks.
2. **Performance Impact**: Creating new service providers is computationally expensive and can impact application performance.
3. **Singleton Duplication**: Multiple service providers can result in multiple instances of services that should be singletons.

## Exceptions
`BuildServiceProvider()` may be acceptable in the following scenarios:
- Unit tests where a full DI container is needed
- Development-time configuration validation
- Tools and utilities that run outside the normal application lifecycle

## How to Fix It
1. In ASP.NET Core applications:
    - Let the framework handle service provider creation
    - Use constructor injection to obtain dependencies
    - Use `IServiceScope` for creating scoped service providers when needed
    - `HttpContext` and other services have methods like `RequestServices.GetService<T>()` to get scoped services
2. For configuration validation:
   ```csharp
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
       // Only in development
       if (Environment.IsDevelopment())
       {
           // Validate service registration
           var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider(validateScopes: true);
           serviceProvider.Dispose();
       }
   }
   ```

## Benefits
- Prevents memory leaks
- Improves application performance
- Ensures proper singleton behavior
- Maintains proper service scoping
