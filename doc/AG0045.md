# Don't Use XPath Selectors in Playwright Locators

ID: AG0045

Type: Bug / Test Reliability

## Summary

Avoid using XPath selectors in Playwright locators as they create brittle tests that are tightly coupled to DOM structure. Instead, use Playwright's recommended locator strategies.

## Explanation

XPath selectors in Playwright:
- Create brittle tests that break with minor UI changes
- Are difficult to read and maintain
- Are tightly coupled to DOM structure
- Are generally slower than other selector strategies
- Don't leverage Playwright's powerful built-in locators
- Often copied from browser dev tools without proper consideration

### Don't ❌

```csharp
// BAD: Using raw XPath copied from browser dev tools
await page.Locator("//div[3]/table/tr[2]/td[1]/span/button").ClickAsync();

// BAD: Using explicit XPath prefix
await page.Locator("xpath=//button[@id='submit-button']").ClickAsync();

// BAD: XPath in variable
string buttonSelector = "//div[@class='form']/button";
await page.Locator(buttonSelector).ClickAsync();

// BAD: Using XPath axes
await page.Locator("//div[contains(@class,'menu')]/following-sibling::div").ClickAsync();
```

### Do ✅

```csharp
// GOOD: Using role-based locator
await page.GetByRole(AriaRole.Button, new() { Name = "Submit" }).ClickAsync();

// GOOD: Using text-based locator
await page.GetByText("Sign Up").ClickAsync();

// GOOD: Using test ID (recommended for testing)
await page.GetByTestId("submit-button").ClickAsync();

// GOOD: Using accessible label
await page.GetByLabel("Username").FillAsync("user123");

// GOOD: Using CSS when necessary (still better than XPath)
await page.Locator(".submit-container > button.primary").ClickAsync();
```

## Why Avoid XPath?

- Brittle tests that break with minor UI changes
- Poor readability and maintainability
- Tight coupling to DOM structure
- Slower execution compared to other selectors
- Miss out on Playwright's powerful locator features
- Often copied from browser tools without proper consideration
- Harder to debug when tests fail

## Best Practices

1. Use role-based selectors:
   - `GetByRole()` - Most reliable and accessible
   - `GetByText()` - For text content
   - `GetByLabel()` - For form labels
   - `GetByPlaceholder()` - For input placeholders

2. Use test-specific attributes:
   - `GetByTestId()` - Add data-testid attributes for testing
   - `GetByTestId()` - Most reliable for test automation

3. Use CSS selectors as fallback:
   - More stable than XPath
   - Better performance
   - Still maintainable

4. Avoid structure-dependent selectors:
   - Don't rely on element position
   - Don't use complex DOM paths
   - Don't copy selectors from browser tools

Remember: The goal is to write maintainable, reliable tests that don't break with minor UI changes.
