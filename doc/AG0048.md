# AG0048: Do not pass exception as message parameter to logger methods

## Cause

An exception was passed as a message parameter to a logger method instead of being passed as the first parameter.

## Rule description

When logging exceptions, they should be passed as the first parameter to logger methods to ensure proper exception handling and logging. This applies to both Microsoft.Extensions.Logging and Serilog loggers.

For example:

```csharp
// Incorrect
_logger.LogError("Something went wrong", ex);

// Correct
_logger.LogError(ex, "Something went wrong");
```

## How to fix violations

Move the exception to be the first parameter of the logger method call.

## When to suppress warnings

This warning should not be suppressed as it indicates a potential issue with exception logging that could lead to missing or incomplete exception information in logs.

## Example of a violation

```csharp
try
{
    // Some code that might throw
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    _logger.LogError("Operation failed", ex); // Violation
}
```

## Example of how to fix

```csharp
try
{
    // Some code that might throw
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    _logger.LogError(ex, "Operation failed"); // Fixed
}
```
