# Don't Use Force Option in Playwright Locators

ID: AG0044

Type: Bug / Test Reliability

## Summary

Avoid using `Force = true` in Playwright's Locator methods. This option bypasses important validation checks and creates unreliable tests that don't accurately reflect real user interactions.

## Explanation

Using Force option:

- Skips critical element state validations
- Hides real UI/UX issues
- Creates unreliable tests
- Makes debugging harder
- Doesn't reflect actual user behavior
- Can mask timing problems

### Don't ❌

```csharp
// Forcing clicks without validation
await button.ClickAsync(new() { Force = true });

// Multiple forced interactions
await textbox.FillAsync("text", new() { Force = true });
await checkbox.CheckAsync(new() { Force = true });

// Pre-defined forced options
var options = new LocatorClickOptions { Force = true };
await element.ClickAsync(options);
```

### Do ✅

```csharp
// Use default behavior
await button.ClickAsync();

// Use proper wait strategies
await textbox.WaitForAsync();
await textbox.FillAsync("text");

// Adjust timeouts if needed
await element.ClickAsync(new() { Timeout = 10000 });

// Wait for specific states
await element.WaitForAsync(new() 
{ 
    State = WaitForSelectorState.Visible 
});
```

## Why Avoid Force Option?

- Skips visibility checks
- Ignores element attachment to DOM
- Bypasses enabled state validation
- Misses element stability checks
- Creates flaky tests
- Hides real application issues
- Makes tests unreliable
- Doesn't match user behavior

Remember: Let Playwright's built-in validations ensure your tests accurately reflect real user interactions.
