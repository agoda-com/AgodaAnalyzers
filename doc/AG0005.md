Test method names should clearly communicate what is being tested, under what conditions, and the expected outcome. This makes tests serve as documentation and helps quickly identify what failed when tests break.

Test names should follow this pattern:

- Class: `<ClassNameUnderTest>Tests`
- Methods: `<SystemUnderTest>_<PreCondition>_<PostCondition>` or `<SystemUnderTest>_<PostCondition>`

#### Don't

```csharp
[Test]
public void HazardLightsTest() // Noncompliant - unclear what aspect is being tested
{...}
```

#### Do

```csharp
[Test]
public void HazardLightsToggleButton_WhenPushedWithLightsBlinking_StopsLightsBlinking()
{...}
```

Poor test names create several problems:

- Makes it harder to understand test failures without reading the implementation
- Reduces test suite's value as documentation
- Makes it difficult to identify missing test cases
- Complicates test maintenance and refactoring
- Makes it harder for team members to understand test coverage

If naming a test is difficult, it might indicate the test is doing too much and should be split into more focused tests. Good test names help ensure:

- Clear test purpose
- Easy identification of failures
- Documentation of behavior
- Coverage visibility
- Maintainable test suite
