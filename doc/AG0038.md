# Don't Use #region Directives

ID: AG0038

Type: Code Smell

## Summary

The `#region` directive should not be used to organize code. If you feel the need for regions, it's a sign that your code needs refactoring.

## Explanation

Using `#region` directives:

- Hides complexity instead of addressing it
- Encourages large, poorly organized classes
- Makes code harder to review and maintain
- Masks code structure issues
- Creates artificial groupings
- Defaults to collapsed in many editors, hiding code
- Makes navigation more difficult

### Don't ❌

```csharp
public class UserManager
{
    #region Fields and Properties
    private readonly IUserRepository _repository;
    private readonly ILogger _logger;
    public bool IsInitialized { get; private set; }
    #endregion

    #region Constructors
    public UserManager(IUserRepository repository, ILogger logger)
    {
        _repository = repository;
        _logger = logger;
    }
    #endregion

    #region Public Methods
    public async Task<User> CreateUser(string username)
    {
        // Implementation
    }
    #endregion

    #region Private Helper Methods
    private void ValidateUser(User user)
    {
        // Implementation
    }
    #endregion
}
```

Instead:

- Break large classes into smaller ones
- Use proper class organization
- Extract related functionality
- Create well-named methods
- Follow Single Responsibility Principle
- Use proper abstraction layers

Remember: If you need regions, your code probably needs refactoring instead.
