Test fixture inheritance should be avoided as it creates hidden dependencies, makes tests harder to understand, and violates the test isolation principle. Each test class should be independent and self-contained.

#### Don't ❌

```csharp
[TestFixture]
public class TestClass : BaseTest  // Noncompliant - inheriting from base test class
{
    // Code
}
```

#### Do ✅

```csharp
[TestFixture]
public class TestClass
{
    // Code
}
```

Test fixture inheritance creates several problems:

- Makes test dependencies and setup harder to understand
- Complicates test maintenance due to hidden inherited behavior
- Can lead to unexpected test interactions
- Violates test isolation principle
- Makes it difficult to refactor tests
- Can cause setup/teardown ordering issues
- Reduces test clarity and readability

Instead of inheritance, prefer:

- Composition through helper methods
- Test utility classes
- Builder patterns
- Shared test data factories
- Clear, explicit test setup within each test class

This keeps tests more maintainable and easier to understand at a glance.
