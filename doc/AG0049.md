# AG0049: Redundant ScrollIntoViewIfNeededAsync before ClickAsync

**Category:** Playwright
**Severity:** Warning

## Description
Calling `ScrollIntoViewIfNeededAsync()` immediately before `ClickAsync()` on Playwright locators is redundant. `ClickAsync()` already performs scrolling and other actionability checks. This pattern can mask underlying test issues and should be avoided.

## Bad Example
```csharp
await element.ScrollIntoViewIfNeededAsync();
await element.ClickAsync();
```

## Good Example
```csharp
await element.ClickAsync();
```

## How to Fix
Remove the redundant `ScrollIntoViewIfNeededAsync()` call before `ClickAsync()`.

## Rationale
- Reduces unnecessary code
- Prevents masking of real test issues
- Improves test reliability and maintainability
