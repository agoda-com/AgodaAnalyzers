Test methods with too many input parameters become difficult to understand and maintain. When test cases need many parameters, split them into smaller, more focused tests with clear intentions.

#### Don't ❌

```csharp
[Test]
[TestCase(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)]  // Noncompliant - too many parameters
public void This_Is_NotValid(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f)
{
    // Test becomes hard to understand
}
```

#### Do ✅

```csharp
[Test]
[TestCase(0, 1, 2)]
public void This_Is_Valid1(int a, int b, int c)
{
    // Clear test purpose
}

[Test]
[TestCase(3, 4, 5)]
public void This_Is_Valid2(int d, int e, int f)
{
    // Clear test purpose
}
```

Having too many test parameters creates problems:

- Makes test intention unclear
- Leads to combinatorial explosion of test cases
- Harder to maintain and modify
- Difficult to understand test failures
- Reduces test readability
- Makes refactoring more difficult
- Can hide logical groupings of test cases

Instead:

- Split into multiple focused tests
- Create test data builders
- Use meaningful parameter names
- Group related parameters into objects

This keeps tests clear, maintainable, and easier to understand.
