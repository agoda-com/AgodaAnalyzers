# Selenium Tests Must Indicate Ownership

ID: AG0037

Type: Maintainability

## Summary

All Selenium tests must be decorated with the `[OwnedBy()]` attribute to indicate which team is responsible for maintenance. This can be applied at the class level or individual test level.

## Explanation

Test ownership must be clearly indicated to:

- Enable automatic notification of test failures
- Ensure clear responsibility for maintenance
- Speed up issue resolution
- Prevent orphaned tests
- Maintain test quality over time

### Don't ❌

```csharp
namespace Agoda.Website.Selenium.Tests
{
    public class HotelSearchTests
    {
        [Test]
        public void SearchByLocation() // No ownership specified
        {
            // Test implementation
        }

        [Test]
        public void FilterByPrice() // No ownership specified
        {
            // Test implementation
        }
    }
}
```

### Do ✅

```csharp
namespace Agoda.Website.Selenium.Tests
{
    [OwnedBy(Team.MyTeam)] // Class-level ownership
    public class HotelSearchTests
    {
        [Test]
        public void SearchByLocation()
        {
            // Test implementation
        }

        [Test]
        [OwnedBy(Team.OtherTeam)] // Override for specific test
        public void FilterByPrice()
        {
            // Test implementation
        }
    }
}
```

## How to Apply Ownership

- Use `[OwnedBy(Team.TeamName)]` at class level for all tests owned by one team
- Use test-level attributes to override class-level ownership
- Every test must have ownership either from class or test level
- Use the `Team` enum to specify the owning team

Remember: Clear ownership is crucial for maintaining a healthy test suite and quick issue resolution.
