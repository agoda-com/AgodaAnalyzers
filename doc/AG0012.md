# Test methods must contain assertions

ID: AG0012

Type: Bug

Each test method should contain at least one assertion to verify expected behavior. Tests without assertions don't validate anything and provide a false sense of security.

#### Don't

```csharp
using NUnit.Framework;

public class TestClass
{
    [Test]
    public void This_Is_Not_Valid()  // Noncompliant - no assertions
    {
        int[] arrayToAssert = { 1, 2, 3 };
    }
}
```

#### Do

With NUnit:

```csharp
using NUnit.Framework;

public class TestClass
{
    [Test]
    public void This_Is_Valid()
    {
        int[] arrayToAssert = { 1, 2, 3 };
        Assert.That(arrayToAssert, Has.Exactly(1).EqualTo(3));
    }
}
```

With Shouldly:

```csharp
using NUnit.Framework;
using Shouldly;

public class TestClass
{
    [Test]
    public void This_Is_Valid()
    {
        int[] arrayForShouldBe = { 1, 2, 3 };
        arrayForShouldBe.Length.ShouldBe(3);
    }
}
```

Tests without assertions create problems:

- Don't actually verify any behavior
- Give false confidence in code quality
- May pass even when the code is broken
- Make test intent unclear
- Hard to maintain as requirements aren't explicit
- Can hide bugs by appearing to test functionality

Always include explicit assertions to verify expected behavior in your tests.
