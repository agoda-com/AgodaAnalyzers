# Do Not Use dynamics in C#

ID: AG0030

Type: Bug Risk / Code Smell

## Summary

https://agoda-com.github.io/standards-c-sharp/code-style/dynamics.html

The `dynamic` type should not be used in C# code. It bypasses compile-time type checking and reduces code reliability.

## Explanation

The `dynamic` type was designed for interoperating with dynamically typed languages, but in a statically typed codebase, it:

- Bypasses compile-time type checking
- Hides errors until runtime
- Makes code harder to understand and maintain
- Reduces IDE support and refactoring capabilities
- Degrades performance
- Makes code more error-prone
- Complicates debugging

### Don't ❌

```csharp
// Runtime errors instead of compile-time
dynamic data = GetData();
int result = data.SomeMethod(); // Could fail at runtime

// Type safety lost
dynamic config = new ExpandoObject();
config.Setting = "value";      // No IntelliSense or compile checks

// Unnecessary dynamic usage
dynamic json = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(jsonString);
var name = json.name;          // Use strongly typed models instead
```

## Why Avoid dynamic?

1. **Safety**: No compile-time type checking
2. **Performance**: Runtime binding is slower
3. **Tooling**: Limited IDE support and refactoring
4. **Maintainability**: Code intent is unclear
5. **Debugging**: More difficult to trace issues
6. **Reliability**: More prone to runtime errors
7. **IL Bloat**: The C# compiler generates significant amounts of additional IL code to handle dynamic dispatch, increasing assembly size and load time
8. **Runtime Overhead**: The DLR (Dynamic Language Runtime) infrastructure needed to support dynamic operations adds complexity to the IL and requires additional runtime resources

Instead of `dynamic`:

- Use strongly typed classes/models
- Use interfaces for polymorphism
- Use generics for flexible typing
- Create proper type hierarchies
- Use pattern matching for type handling

Remember: There's almost always a better statically-typed solution than using `dynamic`. The additional IL code generated for dynamic dispatch not only increases your assembly size but also adds unnecessary complexity to your application's runtime behavior.
