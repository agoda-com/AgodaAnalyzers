# Do Not Expose Both Sync and Async Versions of Methods

ID: AG0022

Type: Code Smell / API Design

## Summary

When designing APIs that perform I/O or CPU-intensive work, expose only the asynchronous version of the method. Never provide both synchronous and asynchronous versions of the same functionality.

## Explanation

Providing both sync and async versions of methods:

- Encourages poor practices and sub-optimal choices
- Creates confusion about which method to use
- Leads to performance issues when sync versions are chosen
- Violates the principle of least surprise

Key rules:

- If an operation can be async, it must only be async
- Always suffix async methods with "Async"
- Never provide a synchronous alternative
- Make the decision at design time: sync or async, not both

### Don't ❌

```csharp
interface IFileDownloader
{
    byte[] DownloadFile(string url);              // Don't expose sync version
    Task<byte[]> DownloadFileAsync(string url);   // alongside async
}

interface IDataProcessor 
{
    Result ProcessData(Data data);                // Don't provide
    Task<Result> ProcessDataAsync(Data data);     // both options
}
```

### Do ✅

```csharp
interface IFileDownloader
{
    Task<byte[]> DownloadFileAsync(string url);   // Async only
}

interface IDataProcessor 
{
    Task<Result> ProcessDataAsync(Data data);     // Single, clear choice
}
```

## Why Avoid Dual Versions?

- Prevents confusion about which method to use
- Forces good async practices by default
- Avoids accidental use of blocking operations
- Maintains consistency across the codebase
- Reduces maintenance burden
- Prevents performance issues from choosing sync version

Remember: If an operation could be async, it should only be exposed as async. Never provide a "convenient" sync alternative.
