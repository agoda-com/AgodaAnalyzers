# Use Task.Delay Instead of Thread.Sleep

ID: AG0023

Type: Performance / Code Smell

## Summary

Never use `Thread.Sleep()` for delays in code. Instead, use the asynchronous `Task.Delay()` to avoid blocking threads.

## Explanation

`Thread.Sleep()` blocks the current thread, preventing it from doing any work during the sleep period. This has several negative impacts:
- Reduces server capacity
- Decreases application scalability
- Degrades overall performance
- Wastes thread pool resources
- Can cause deadlocks in UI applications

Using `Task.Delay()` allows the thread to handle other work while waiting for the delay to complete.

### Don't ❌

```csharp
public void ProcessWithDelay()
{
    // Do something
    Thread.Sleep(1000);  // Blocks thread for 1 second
    // Do more stuff
}

public void RetryOperation()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        try
        {
            // Do operation
            return;
        }
        catch
        {
            Thread.Sleep(500);  // Bad! Blocks thread between retries
        }
    }
}
```

### Do ✅

```csharp
public async Task ProcessWithDelayAsync()
{
    // Do something
    await Task.Delay(1000);  // Thread remains free
    // Do more stuff
}

public async Task RetryOperationAsync()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        try
        {
            // Do operation
            return;
        }
        catch
        {
            await Task.Delay(500);  // Good! Thread can do other work
        }
    }
}
```

## Why Use Task.Delay?

- Maintains thread pool efficiency
- Improves application responsiveness
- Better resource utilization
- Prevents UI freezing
- Scales better under load
- Follows async/await best practices

Remember: There's never a good reason to use `Thread.Sleep()` in modern .NET applications.
