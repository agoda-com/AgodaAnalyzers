# Use Async Methods When Available

ID: AG0021

Type: Code Smell / Performance

## Summary

https://agoda-com.github.io/standards-c-sharp/async/consume-async-method.html

Always use the asynchronous version of a method when available. Using synchronous methods when async alternatives exist can impact performance and scalability.

## Explanation

Synchronous operations block threads while waiting for I/O or other operations to complete. This wastes resources and reduces application scalability. Modern .NET provides async versions for most I/O operations and external service calls. You should always prefer these async versions.

Common patterns to avoid:

- Using `File.ReadAllText()` instead of `File.ReadAllTextAsync()`
- Using `HttpClient.GetString()` instead of `HttpClient.GetStringAsync()`
- Using `Stream.Read()` instead of `Stream.ReadAsync()`
- Using `SqlCommand.ExecuteReader()` instead of `SqlCommand.ExecuteReaderAsync()`

### Don't ❌

```csharp
public string GetData()
{
    using var client = new HttpClient();
    return client.GetString("https://api.example.com/data"); // Blocks thread
}

public void SaveFile(string content)
{
    File.WriteAllText("file.txt", content); // Blocks thread
}
```

### Do ✅

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
{
    using var client = new HttpClient();
    return await client.GetStringAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
}

public async Task SaveFileAsync(string content)
{
    await File.WriteAllTextAsync("file.txt", content);
}
```

## Benefits of Async Methods

- Improved application scalability
- Better resource utilization
- Increased responsiveness
- Higher throughput
- No thread blocking during I/O operations
- Better user experience in UI applications

Always check for async alternatives when working with:

- File operations
- Network calls
- Database operations
- External service calls
- Stream operations
- Task-based operations
