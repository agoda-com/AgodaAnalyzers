# Return types implementing IEnumerable should use interface types

ID: AG0018

Type: Code Smell

## Summary

https://agoda-com.github.io/standards-c-sharp/collections/choosing-collection-implementation.html

Public methods and properties that return IEnumerable-implementing types must be declared using specific interface types rather than concrete implementations.

## Explanation

When exposing collections through public APIs, you should return interface types rather than concrete implementations. This provides better encapsulation, flexibility for future changes, and clearer contracts with consumers of your API.

### Allowed Return Types

- `IEnumerable<T>`
- `ISet<T>` 
- `IList<T>`
- `IDictionary<K,V>`
- `IReadOnlyDictionary<K,V>`
- `KeyedCollection<K,V>`
- `byte[]` (special case for raw binary data)
- `string` (which implements `IEnumerable<char>`)

### Don't ❌

```csharp
public List<string> GetStrings() { ... }
public List<string> StringProperty { get; set; }
```

### Do ✅

```csharp
public IList<string> GetStrings() { ... }
public IList<string> StringProperty { get; set; }
```

## Why Avoid Concrete Types?

Returning concrete types like `List<T>` creates several problems:

- Tightly couples your API to specific implementations
- Makes it harder to change implementations without breaking consumers
- Exposes unnecessary implementation details
- May allow consumers to depend on implementation-specific behaviors
- Reduces flexibility for performance optimization or behavior changes

By using interface types, you maintain better control over your API's contract while giving yourself freedom to modify the underlying implementation as needed.

This rule helps ensure consistent and maintainable APIs by enforcing the use of proper abstraction levels when exposing collections.
