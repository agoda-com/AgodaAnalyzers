# Avoid passing HttpContextAccessor as a parameter

ID: AG0009

Type: Code Smell

Passing `IHttpContextAccessor` or `HttpContextAccessor` as a parameter creates tight coupling to ASP.NET Core infrastructure and makes testing difficult. Instead, pass only the specific HTTP context properties that your code actually needs.

#### Don't

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

interface ISomething
{
    void SomeMethod(IHttpContextAccessor c, string sampleString); // Noncompliant
    void SomeMethod(HttpContextAccessor c, string sampleString); // Noncompliant
}

class TestClass : ISomething
{
    public void SomeMethod(IHttpContextAccessor context, string sampleString)
    {
        // Hard to test due to IHttpContextAccessor dependency
    }

    public TestClass(IHttpContextAccessor context)
    {
        // Constructor with unnecessary dependency
    }
}
```

#### Do

```csharp
interface ISomething
{
    void SomeMethod(string userAgent, string sampleString);
}

class TestClass : ISomething
{
    public void SomeMethod(string userAgent, string sampleString)
    {
        // Only depends on what it needs
    }

    public TestClass(string userAgent)
    {
        // Clean constructor with specific dependencies
    }
}
```

Passing HttpContextAccessor creates several problems:

- Makes unit testing difficult since context is complex to mock
- Violates Single Responsibility Principle by potentially accessing many different context properties
- Creates tight coupling to ASP.NET Core infrastructure
- Obscures the actual dependencies of your code
- Makes it harder to port code to other platforms or frameworks

Instead, identify and pass only the specific context properties your code needs (like UserAgent, Request.Path, etc). This improves testability and makes dependencies explicit.
