# Use Task.Run Instead of Task.Factory.StartNew

ID: AG0024

Type: Code Smell / Best Practice

## Summary

https://agoda-com.github.io/standards-c-sharp/async/task-run.html

Avoid using `Task.Factory.StartNew` as it's complex and error-prone. Use `Task.Run` for most scenarios as it provides safer defaults and clearer semantics.

## Explanation

`Task.Factory.StartNew` is a low-level API with many pitfalls:

- Complex configuration options that are easy to misuse
- Doesn't handle async delegates properly by default
- Can lead to unexpected behavior with task scheduling
- Requires careful consideration of TaskCreationOptions
- Can cause issues with task continuations

Only use `Task.Factory.StartNew` in very specific scenarios, such as when `TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning` is needed (and even then, consider alternatives).

### Don't ❌

```csharp
// Complex and error-prone
Task.Factory.StartNew(MyMethod, 
    CancellationToken.None,
    TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach, 
    TaskScheduler.Default);

// Doesn't handle async delegates correctly
Task.Factory.StartNew(async () => await DoWorkAsync());

// Unnecessarily complex
Task.Factory.StartNew(() => DoWork(), 
    TaskCreationOptions.None);
```

### Do ✅

```csharp
// Simple and safe
Task.Run(() => MyMethod());

// Properly handles async delegates
Task.Run(async () => await DoWorkAsync());

// Clear intent, proper defaults
Task.Run(() => DoWork());
```

## Why Avoid Task.Factory.StartNew?

- More complex than necessary for most use cases
- Easy to misconfigure
- Can cause unexpected behaviors
- Poor handling of async delegates by default
- Requires deep understanding of TPL internals
- `Task.Run` provides better defaults and safer behavior

Remember: Use `Task.Run` by default. Only consider `Task.Factory.StartNew` if you have a specific need that's been verified through profiling.
