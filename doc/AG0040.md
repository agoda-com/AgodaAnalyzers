# Don't Use WaitUntilState.NetworkIdle in Playwright

ID: AG0040

Type: Bug Risk / Test Reliability

## Summary

Avoid using `WaitUntilState.NetworkIdle` in Playwright tests as it creates flaky tests. Instead, use explicit web assertions to verify page readiness.

## Explanation

`WaitUntilState.NetworkIdle` can cause tests to be unreliable because:

- Network activity can be unpredictable
- Background requests may interfere
- Third-party resources can cause delays
- Analytics and tracking can trigger false waits
- CDN behavior can vary
- Network conditions can fluctuate

### Don't ❌

```csharp
// Flaky - depends on network stability
await page.GotoAsync(url, new() { 
    WaitUntil = WaitUntilState.NetworkIdle 
});

// Unreliable timing
await page.ClickAsync("button", new() {
    WaitUntil = WaitUntilState.NetworkIdle
});
```

### Do ✅

```csharp
// Wait for specific elements or states
await page.WaitForSelectorAsync(".content-loaded");

// Use explicit assertions
await Expect(page.Locator(".data-table"))
    .ToBeVisibleAsync();

// Check for specific conditions
await page.WaitForFunctionAsync("() => window.dataLoaded === true");
```

## Why Avoid NetworkIdle?

- Creates non-deterministic tests
- Increases test flakiness
- Leads to timeout issues
- Makes tests environment-dependent
- Hides actual loading issues
- Difficult to debug failures

Instead:

- Wait for specific UI elements
- Use explicit assertions
- Check for application state
- Verify data loading completion
- Use meaningful selectors
- Test for actual readiness conditions

Remember: Reliable tests depend on explicit, deterministic conditions, not network activity.
