# Prevent use of InternalsVisibleTo Attribute

ID: AG0019

Type: Code Smell

## Summary

https://agoda-com.github.io/standards-c-sharp/unit-testing/only-test-the-public-interface.html

The `InternalsVisibleTo` attribute should not be used as it violates encapsulation principles and creates tight coupling between test code and implementation details.

## Explanation

Making internal members visible to test assemblies is a common but problematic practice that:

- Violates encapsulation principles
- Creates tight coupling between tests and implementation
- Makes tests brittle and harder to maintain
- Makes refactoring more difficult
- Encourages testing implementation details instead of behavior

You should only test the public surface of your classes. If you find yourself needing to test internal methods, consider:

- Making the method public if it represents actual API surface
- Refactoring the code to better expose the behavior through public methods
- Rethinking the design to avoid the need to test internals

### Don't ❌

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Agoda.Website.UnitTestFramework")]
namespace RoslynTest
{
    // ...
}
```

### Do ✅

```csharp
using System;

namespace RoslynTest
{
    // Design your public API to be testable without exposing internals
}
```

## Why Avoid InternalsVisibleTo?

Using `InternalsVisibleTo` leads to several problems:

- Tests become coupled to implementation details rather than behavior
- Changes to internal implementation can break tests
- Makes refactoring more difficult as tests depend on internal structure
- Violates encapsulation principles
- Can hide poor API design by allowing tests to bypass public interfaces

Focus on testing behavior through public interfaces rather than implementation details through internal members.
