# Avoid direct QueryString access

Direct access to `QueryString` collection bypasses ASP.NET model binding, which provides validation, type conversion, and security features. Always use model binding with action method parameters instead.

#### Don't ❌

```csharp
public ActionResult Index()
{
    var id = HttpContext.Current.Request.QueryString["id"]; // Noncompliant
    // Use id here
}
```

#### Do ✅

```csharp
public ActionResult Index([FromQuery] int id)
{
    // Use id here
}
```

Direct QueryString access creates several problems:

- Bypasses model validation
- No automatic type conversion
- Potential security vulnerabilities from unvalidated input
- Makes testing harder as it depends on HttpContext
- Code is more verbose and error-prone
- No automatic null handling
- No automatic binding to complex types
- Harder to maintain and modify

Model binding provides:

- Automatic type conversion
- Input validation
- Security features
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Better testability
- Support for complex object binding
- Clear parameter intent through attributes

Always use model binding to handle query string parameters in a safe and maintainable way.
