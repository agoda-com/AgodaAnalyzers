# TestContainer Build() Must Be Called After Setting Environment Variable

ID: AG0047

Type: Bug / Configuration

## Summary

When using TestContainers with a mirror/proxy pull-through cache for Docker, the `TESTCONTAINERS_HUB_IMAGE_NAME_PREFIX` environment variable must be set before calling `Build()` on any container. This ensures that all container images are pulled from the correct mirror.

## Explanation

TestContainers uses Docker to run containers for testing. When using a mirror/proxy pull-through cache for Docker, you need to set the `TESTCONTAINERS_HUB_IMAGE_NAME_PREFIX` environment variable to point to your internal mirror. This variable must be set before any container's `Build()` method is called, otherwise the images will be pulled from the default Docker Hub instead of your mirror.

### Don't ❌

```csharp
public class TestClass
{
    // Build() called before setting environment variable
    private readonly INetwork _network = new NetworkBuilder()
        .WithName("shared_test_network")
        .Build();

    public void Setup()
    {
        // Too late! Images already pulled from Docker Hub
        Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("TESTCONTAINERS_HUB_IMAGE_NAME_PREFIX", "YOUR_INTERNAL_MIRROR");
    }
}
```

### Do ✅

```csharp
public class TestClass
{
    public void Setup()
    {
        // Set environment variable first
        Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("TESTCONTAINERS_HUB_IMAGE_NAME_PREFIX", "YOUR_INTERNAL_MIRROR");
        
        // Then build containers
        var network = new NetworkBuilder()
            .WithName("shared_test_network")
            .Build();
    }
}
```

## Why Set Environment Variable First?

- Ensures all container images are pulled from your internal mirror
- Prevents pulling images from public Docker Hub
- Maintains consistent image sources across your organization
- Reduces external network dependencies
- Improves build reliability and speed
- Enforces security policies

## Best Practices

1. Set the environment variable at the start of your test setup
2. Consider setting it in your test framework's initialization
3. Document the required environment variable in your project's README
4. Use consistent mirror URLs across your organization
5. Consider adding the environment variable to your CI/CD pipeline configuration
