# Classes should only expose functionality used in their public interface

ID: AG0002

Type: Code Smell

When implementing an interface, classes should only expose methods that are part of their public contract. Additional public or internal methods that aren't part of the implemented interfaces create confusion about the class's responsibilities and violate the Interface Segregation Principle.

#### Don't ❌

```csharp
interface ISomething 
{
    void DoSomething();
}
        
class TestClass : ISomething 
{
    public void DoSomething() 
    {
    }
    internal void DoSomething2() // Noncompliant - not part of interface
    {
    }
}
```

#### Do ✅

```csharp
interface ISomething 
{
    void DoSomething();
}
        
class TestClass : ISomething 
{
    public void DoSomething() 
    {
    }
}
```

Adding methods that aren't part of the interface creates several problems:

- Violates Interface Segregation Principle by potentially forcing clients to depend on methods they don't use
- Makes the code harder to understand and maintain by obscuring the class's true responsibilities
- Can lead to tight coupling if these additional methods are used by other classes
- Makes testing more difficult as you need to consider methods outside the interface contract

If additional functionality is needed, consider creating a new interface that better represents the complete contract of the class.
