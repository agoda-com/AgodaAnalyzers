# Use CSS Selectors Instead of XPath in Selenium Tests

ID: AG0026

Type: Code Style / Best Practice

## Summary

In Selenium tests, use CSS selectors instead of XPath to locate elements. CSS selectors are more familiar, easier to read, and maintain.

## Explanation

XPath selectors:

- Are harder to read and understand
- Have complex syntax that's error-prone
- Require additional knowledge beyond web development
- Add unnecessary complexity to test code
- Are less maintainable
- Can be slower than CSS selectors in some browsers

CSS selectors leverage knowledge that web developers already have and are more intuitive.

### Don't ❌

```csharp
// Complex and hard to understand
Driver.FindElements(By.XPath(".//*[@data-selenium='hotel-item']"));

// Confusing hierarchy navigation
Driver.FindElement(By.XPath("//div/span/parent::div//a"));

// Complex attribute selection
Driver.FindElement(By.XPath("//input[contains(@class, 'submit-button')]"));
```

### Do ✅

```csharp
// Clear and simple
Driver.FindElements(By.CssSelector("[data-selenium=hotel-item]"));

// Alternative direct method
Driver.FindElementsByCssSelector("[data-selenium=hotel-item]");

// Familiar CSS patterns
Driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(".submit-button"));
```

## Why Avoid XPath?

- More complex syntax than CSS
- Harder to maintain and debug
- Requires learning additional syntax
- Less performant in some browsers
- Not as intuitive as CSS selectors
- Teams are more familiar with CSS

Remember: Use data attributes with CSS selectors for the most maintainable test code.
