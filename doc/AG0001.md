# Avoid direct usage of DependencyResolver

Direct usage of `DependencyResolver` creates tight coupling and makes code harder to test. Dependencies should be explicitly declared through constructor injection, which promotes:

- Better testability through clear dependency declaration
- Improved maintainability by making dependencies visible
- Stronger adherence to SOLID principles, particularly Dependency Inversion

#### Don't

```c#
var exampleService = DependencyResolver.Current.GetService<IExampleService>();
```

#### Do

```c#
public class ExampleClass
{
    public ExampleClass(IExampleService exampleService) { }
}
```

The use of `DependencyResolver.Current` creates several problems:

- It makes unit testing more difficult since you can't easily mock dependencies
- It hides class dependencies, making the code harder to understand and maintain
- It bypasses the dependency injection container's lifecycle management
- It creates a direct dependency on the DI container, violating the Service Locator anti-pattern

Always prefer constructor injection to make dependencies explicit and improve code quality.
