# Logger Exception Parameter Analyzer

ID: AG0048

Type: Bug / Test Reliability

## Description
This rule ensures that exceptions are passed as the first parameter to logger methods, rather than as the message parameter.

## Why
Passing exceptions as the first parameter allows for better error tracking and logging.

## How to Fix
Ensure that exceptions are passed as the first parameter to logger methods.

## Example
```csharp
// Incorrect
_logger.LogError("Something went wrong", ex);

// Correct
_logger.LogError(ex, "Something went wrong");
```
